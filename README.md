The Rural Bank of Nepal banking application is a prime example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles applied to a real-world financial system. The design's main element is the abstract BankAccount class, which contains basic banking attributes such the name, number, and balance of the account holder. Important functions like deposit(), withdraw(), and displayAccountDetails() are defined by this abstract class, enabling polymorphism through various implementations in derived classes. The system has two distinct account types: CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount. Through method overriding, each of these account types exhibits unique behavior. While the Current Account offers an overdraft option that permits transactions up to a predetermined limit even with insufficient money, the Savings Account has restrictive balance limits during withdrawals and an interest accumulating feature. Careful access control is shown by the parent class's usage of protected visibility for the balance field. A new InsufficientBalanceException class, which builds on Java's Exception class to produce domain-specific error reporting, is used to implement error handling. By keeping track of a list of BankAccount objects, the Customer class uses composition to prevent inheritance abuse and enable dynamic account addition and deletion. The Main class implements a text-based interface that makes use of all OOP capabilities, acting as the system's entry point.
